            <h1>Business Philosophy</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Success in the restaurant industry requires more than just great food – it demands operational excellence, regulatory compliance, and sustainable practices. Seth Markwood's business philosophy reflects a holistic approach to helping food service establishments thrive.</p>

            <h2>Customer-First Mindset</h2>
            <p>Every restaurant has a unique story, unique challenges, and unique goals. The foundation of effective grease management isn't selling products – it's understanding each client's specific situation and providing solutions that genuinely improve their operations. When restaurants succeed, everyone benefits.</p>

            <h2>Education Over Sales</h2>
            <p>Knowledge empowers better decisions. By educating clients about grease management principles, regulatory requirements, and best practices, establishments can make informed choices that serve their long-term interests. An educated customer becomes a successful partner.</p>

            <h2>Sustainability & Responsibility</h2>
            <p>Proper grease management isn't just about compliance – it's about environmental stewardship. By preventing FOG from entering wastewater systems, we protect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Municipal infrastructure from costly damage</li>
                <li>Natural waterways from pollution</li>
                <li>Communities from sewer overflows</li>
                <li>Future generations from environmental degradation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Partnership Approach</h2>
            <p>The relationship doesn't end at installation. True partnership means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ongoing support and troubleshooting</li>
                <li>Regular check-ins to ensure system performance</li>
                <li>Updates on regulatory changes</li>
                <li>Optimization recommendations as operations evolve</li>
                <li>Emergency support when challenges arise</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Innovation & Adaptation</h2>
            <p>The food service industry constantly evolves – from new cooking techniques to changing regulations. Staying ahead requires continuous learning, technological advancement, and the flexibility to adapt solutions to emerging challenges.</p>

            <h2>Values-Driven Leadership</h2>
            <p>Drawing from his background in ministry and education, Seth brings a servant-leadership approach to business. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrity in all interactions</li>
                <li>Transparency in recommendations</li>
                <li>Commitment to client success</li>
                <li>Building trust through consistent delivery</li>
                <li>Contributing positively to the community</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>When restaurants can stop worrying about grease management, they can focus on what matters most: creating exceptional dining experiences for their customers. By removing operational obstacles and ensuring compliance, we enable restaurants to pursue their passion and grow their business with confidence.</p>
